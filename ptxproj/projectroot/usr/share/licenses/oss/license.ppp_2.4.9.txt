chat/chat.c

This software is in the public domain.

common/zlib.c

This file is derived from various .h and .c files from the zlib-1.0.4
distribution by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, with some additions
by Paul Mackerras to aid in implementing Deflate compression and
decompression for PPP packets.  See zlib.h for conditions of
distribution and use.

Changes that have been made include:
- added Z_PACKET_FLUSH (see zlib.h for details)
- added inflateIncomp and deflateOutputPending
- allow strm->next_out to be NULL, meaning discard the output

common/zlib.h

Original version by James Carlson

This implementation of EAP supports MD5-Challenge and SRP-SHA1
authentication styles.  Note that support of MD5-Challenge is a
requirement of RFC 2284, and that it's essentially just a
reimplementation of regular RFC 1994 CHAP using EAP messages.

As an authenticator ("server"), there are multiple phases for each
style.  In the first phase of each style, the unauthenticated peer
name is queried using the EAP Identity request type.  If the
"remotename" option is used, then this phase is skipped, because
the peer's name is presumed to be known.

For MD5-Challenge, there are two phases, and the second phase
consists of sending the challenge itself and handling the
associated response.

For SRP-SHA1, there are four phases.  The second sends 's', 'N',
and 'g'.  The reply contains 'A'.  The third sends 'B', and the
reply contains 'M1'.  The forth sends the 'M2' value.

As an authenticatee ("client"), there's just a single phase --
responding to the queries generated by the peer.  EAP is an
authenticator-driven protocol.
