	bool
	prompt "enable deep packet loss concealment (PLC)"
	help
	  Improves voice quality under sporadic packet loss, by using a deep
	  neural network to help with filling in short audio gaps in the
	  decoder. The decoder complexity needs to be set to 5 or more for this.
	  Increases binary size by about 1 MiB.
	  For details, see https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/.

config OPUS_OSCE
	bool
	select OPUS_DEEP_PLC
	prompt "enable opus speech coding enhancement (OSCE)"
	help
	  Improves voice quality of low-bitrate streams by applying voice
	  enhancements in the decoder.
	  A Linear Adaptive Coding Enhancer (LACE, ~100 MFLOPS) is used at
	  decoder complexity setting 6, and a Non-Linear variation (NoLACE,
	  ~400 MFLOPS) is used at decoder complexity setting 7.
	  Increases binary size by about 1.6 MiB.
	  For details, see https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/.
